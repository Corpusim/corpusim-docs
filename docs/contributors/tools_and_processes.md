| Method                        | Status  | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cyclical                      | Active  | Not waterfall, basically. Corpusim is a living project that moves through iterative development. We are agile. |
| Trunk-based Development (TBD) | Active  | We have a single `main` branch in our repository, which receives regular merges from short-lived branches. |
| Continuous Integration        | Planned | With proper test coverage, we will be integrating new work continuously with merges. |
| Test-driven Development | Evaluating | Testing is highest priority. Test for desired behavior to facilitate frequent merges of TBD. |
