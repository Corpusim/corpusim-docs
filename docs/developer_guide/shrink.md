The **Probe** is the object controlled by the user in the simulated environment.

**Shrink** is how "small" the Probe is.

The word `Shrink` may be capitalized or written in `code` format to indicate that the word is referring to this unique value.

`Shrink` plays a role across different areas of Corpusim, for example:

- `hierarch.gd` : determines what objects should be present in the scene around the Probe.
- `ST_BVH.gdshader` : determines what noise to apply to SDFShapes.
